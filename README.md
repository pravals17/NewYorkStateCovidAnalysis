This project demonstrates the spatial spread of coronavirus in the New York state in the USA based on data from March 01, 2020 to April 14, 2020. It uses various parameters such as population density and social vulnerability at county level in the state of New York to determine areas in the state where people are at higher risk of getting infected by the virus. Finally, it examines the possible hotspot regions/counties based on the risk value associated with them using Getis-Ord Gi* statistic.

The project uses ArcGIS Pro for the analysis.
